/*
    Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, 
    solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
    DP is mostly used when we have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure while performing recursion.
    Hence, Dynamic Programming is also called as Optimised Recursion.

    In DP, we use an extra Data Structure(Array, Map, etc)to store the results of the subproblems so that we don't have to solve them again.

    There are two ways to solve a problem using DP:
    1. Top Down Approach (Memoization)  : 
    2. Bottom Up Approach (Tabulation)

    DP is performed on a problem, iff the problem satisfies the following properties:-
    1. Optimal Substructure
    2. Overlapping Subproblems (Multiple Branches in Recursion Tree)
